These practices result in significant aggregation biases that affect the accuracy of traffic and revenue forecasts.Whenever possible, random coefficients should be used to estimate the distribution of VOT across the population. For general use, newer activity-based forecasting models that use a microsimulation approach can simulate a different VOT for each person and trip, providing the most disaggregate treatment of VOT, and thus avoiding one important source of possible errors and biases in the forecasts.")])])])])},function(){var e=this.$createElement,t=this._self._c||e;return t("h4",{attrs:{id:"model-deployment-research-shrpii-c10"}},[t("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#model-deployment-research-shrpii-c10","aria-hidden":"true"}},[this._v("#")]),this._v(" Model Deployment Research (SHRPII C10)")])},function(){var e=this.$createElement,t=this._self._c||e;return t("p",[this._v("The most promising long-term direction for DTA modeling is the "),t("a",{attrs:{href:"Integrated_Travel_Demand_and_Network_Models",title:"wikilink"}},[this._v("integration of an activity-based demand model with DTA")]),this._v(", in which both models are implemented in a fully disaggregate microsimulation fashion with enhanced typological, temporal, and spatial resolution.")])},function(){var e=this.$createElement,t=this._self._c||e;return t("h2",{attrs:{id:"application-experience"}},[t("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#application-experience","aria-hidden":"true"}},[this._v("#")]),this._v(" Application Experience")])},function(){var e=this.$createElement,t=this._self._c||e;return t("h3",{attrs:{id:"congestion-pricing-in-san-francisco-sfcta"}},[t("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#congestion-pricing-in-san-francisco-sfcta","aria-hidden":"true"}},[this._v("#")]),this._v(" Congestion Pricing in San Francisco (SFCTA)")])},function(){var e=this.$createElement,t=this._self._c||e;return t("p",[this._v("The SFCTA’s travel demand model "),t("a",{attrs:{href:"SFCTA's_Experience_Using_its_SF-CHAMP_Activity-Based_Model",title:"wikilink"}},[this._v("“SF-CHAMP”")]),this._v(" was one of the first activity-based travel demand models used in practice in the U.S., and has undergone a number of updates to support project and long range planning needs.
